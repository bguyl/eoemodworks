**Build Mod**
______________________________________________________________________________________________

To build a mod you have to fill the path to the game mod directory :
The path to your game directory/EdgeOfEternity_Data/StreamingAssets/Mods
If the directory does not exist you have to create it,

After that just launch the game and the mod should appear on the game Mods menu

Please first before building a mod make sure that you filled the mod settings in the Mod Settings 
menu otherwise your mod wont build
